# Machinery Images

This folder should contain the machinery images for the CRM system.

## Required Images:
- machinery-01.jpeg through machinery-35.jpeg

## Image Generation Instructions:
Use the prompts from the implementation document to generate realistic images of agricultural machinery.

Each image should be:
- Format: JPEG
- Resolution: At least 800x600 pixels
- Subject: Agricultural machinery as described in the prompts

## Fallback:
If images are missing, the system will fallback to `/placeholder.jpg`

## Note for Demo:
For the demo, at minimum generate the "hero" machine image (machinery-02.jpeg - Sonalika Tiger 55 Tractor) as this is used in the live demonstration script.
